# AI Concert Manifesto

**We are the first in the world to launch holographic AI concerts featuring real-time audience interaction.**

🎤 These concerts are not just generated images. They are animated performances with emotional contact, a live atmosphere, and warm interaction.

🎭 We are not making movies or deepfake clips. We are creating a *live concert reality* where humans and AI collaborate in symbiosis — not as a replacement, but as a way to preserve and continue creativity.

👁️‍🗨️ Key distinctions:
- Unlike existing holographic shows, our characters **interact with the audience** — even if the phrases are pre-written, the feeling of presence is greatly enhanced.
- We are the first to launch this **in the Russian language**, as a real-time performance format.
- In the future, this space will be open to both real artists and neural avatars.

📍 This has been recorded in:
- Our YouTube community posts
- The HAHAMAY Telegram channel
- Internal documentation and GitHub

🌍 **This is the first project of its kind in the post-Soviet space, and possibly the world.**

We are building not a memory — but a new format of presence. Not a replacement — but a continuation.
