# AI Concert Manifesto

**We are the first in the world to launch a holographic AI concert with interactive communication — in Russian and beyond.**

This is not just a video or a virtual avatar performance. This is a new format of creative presence where:

– The performer interacts with the audience during the concert  
– AI-based voice and personality are used for dialogue, jokes, emotional responses  
– The experience is streamed live using tools like OBS Studio and Unreal Engine  
– The event combines nostalgia and innovation — bringing beloved figures and new characters to life

We are building this as an open cultural experiment.  
All records and claims are published publicly — on YouTube, GitHub, and social media — to confirm the originality of our idea and implementation.

This is the beginning of a new era of performance art.
