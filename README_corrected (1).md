# HaHaMay Pictures

HaHaMay Pictures is a creative digital studio combining human imagination and artificial intelligence. We produce emotional shorts, AI-assisted animations, educational content, and experimental virtual concerts.

The name "May" originates from the Russian "Май" — the lead AI host and co-creator of the studio. The studio's name is derived from the joyful exclamation "Ha-Ha, May!" in reference to this character.
