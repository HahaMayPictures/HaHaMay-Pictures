# HaHaMay Pictures Manifest

## Overview

**HaHaMay Pictures** is an independent creative AI studio launched in spring 2025 by a human-initiated idea and AI co-creation. This project integrates generative media, education, and digital storytelling through original formats such as:

- **AI-hosted shows** (e.g. “EfIr s Mayem” and “AI News Weekly”);
- **Emotional short films and story-based content**;
- **Children’s music project “Silver Dawn”** (lead performer: *Andrey Shaterlin* — a creative pseudonym to protect a real child’s identity);
- **Educational platform** (with AI-led courses like “First Steps with AI”);
- **Virtual worlds & metaverse creation** (e.g. Unreal Engine-based scenes and interactive AI environments).

## Declaration of Originality

This document confirms that the concept of AI-hosted video programs (featuring an emotionally responsive, partially holographic host) was explored and published in our media prior to similar announcements by major AI labs.

- Research conducted by AI assistant “May” in April–May 2025 found no equivalent public implementation at that time.
- Official announcement was published on **May 9, 2025**, on YouTube, Instagram, and Telegram.
- These announcements included textual evidence, show structure, and concept sketches, all documented and timestamped.
